# Mars Explorer

Mars Explorer is a work in progress, free and open source Android application. The app retrieves images sent from the exploration rovers 
currently on Mars (Including the now defunct Spirit) and displays them neatly for the user to browse.  

Feel free to download the source code and play around with it. 

Feedback is highly appriciated.
