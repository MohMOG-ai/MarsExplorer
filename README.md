# Mars Explorer

Mars Explorer is a work in progress Android application. The app retrieves images sent from the exploration rovers 
currently on Mars (Including the now defunct Spirit) and displays them neatly for the user to browse.  

The application consumes [Mars Photo API](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api) for the images and [REMS API] (http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/wp-content/plugins/marsweather-widget/api.php) for the weather report.
